## Setup
First of all you have to add the badges to your README. 
Note that if you want to customize the badges you might have to tweak the regeular expressions used to match your badges.
Here are the default ones:

| Badge                                                | Raw Badge                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/day%20üìÖ-5-blue)     | `![](https://img.shields.io/badge/day%20üìÖ-5-blue)`     |
| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stars%20‚≠ê-10-yellow) | `![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stars%20‚≠ê-10-yellow)` |

The default values for the regular expressions can be found in the [`actions.yml`](https://github.com/joblo2213/AoC-badges/blob/master/action.yml)
if you need to tweak them.

```
